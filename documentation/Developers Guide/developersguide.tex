\section{Introduction}

\section{Code -- LEGO\textregistered\, tape}

The project nxt contains classes to operate on the LEGO\textregistered\, modules. There are the two main classes, MainMaster and MainSlave which are responsible for receiving and executing commands. The Master also has methods to send the read character to the pc receiver. Functions for the tape like moving left and right are provided by the class Tape. It also implements a counter to determine the position of the tape and a security timer. \\
Also the Common class is implemented which is used by both Master and Slave providing functions like pushing bits, playing sounds etc.\\
There are some more common classes that can be used for testing the sensors or calibrate them.

\section{AppData}

The tape styles, like the example files are installed in the user's home directory, when you start the program for the first time. If you change them, you wil have to change the version number in the pc/gui/AppData.java file, so that the files are being updated in the user directory.


The folder where the AppData is stored differs with your operating system:

\begin{itemize}
\item Linux: \$/.TuringBrain IDE
\item OS X: \$/Library/Application Support/Turing Brain IDE
\item Other: \$/Turing Brain IDE
\end{itemize}

\section{Adding new tape styles}
\label{sec:adding-new-tape}

The tape panels (showed in the simulation window) are themeable. The themes are stored in the source code in the pc/tape/images/styles directory. Each folder in this directory is a theme (the folder name is the theme name). Every tape style folder must contain two images: head.png and tape\_field.png. These images should have exactly the same size. Recommend is a size of 28 x 32, but you can also use diffrent sizes. The font size is scaled dynamically with the image size. The head.png should be transparent in the middle, otherwise you won't see the field content.

\section{Protocol}

This section is an overview over the protocol that is used for the communication between the PC and the LEGO\textregistered\, NXT robots. The communication works via bluetooth and is character based. Usually one character is one command. Some commands (i.e. machine name command) are followed by a character sequence of arbitrary length terminated by a newline character.

The following tables show the complete list of commands sent by the pc to the master. The NXT modules only respond to previous commands by the pc, they will never send commands spontaneously to the pc. The response to most commands is either a ``.'' (ok, success) or ``!'' (failure). The read command is responded by the read symbol.

n<name>\textbackslash n & machine name\\
x<name>\textbackslash n & state name
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

\section{Add new machine Types}

If you want to add a new machine type you have to create new packages for the machine and the editor. The machine package must consist of an inheritance of machine.Machine and machine.Simulation. The editor package must only consist of  an inheritance of gui.MachineEditor. Additionally, to be able to open your machine files, you have to adapt the FileChooser in gui.Editor.openFile() and add your machine's file extension to it. \\
You can also add your machine type to the menu item \textit{New} in the menubar of gui.Editor. Optionally you can add your machine type as a new tab to gui.WelcomeScreen.\\
For more information on the methods that have to be written you can view our Javadoc.
